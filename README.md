# SIMULINO 2000 (2D Physics Engine CUDA)
======================

A scalable C++ Physics Engine with CUDA integration.

## Features:
1. Verlet integration engine.
1. Integration with nVidia CUDA run time library (on available devices) for N-body simulation.
1. Scalable and easy to add new simulations.
1. Basic UI, with buttons and labels.
1. Extensive documentation (in docs/html/index.html).

## Interactive Simulations:
1. Cloth computed on CPU. The cloth can be dragged around clicking and holding the mouse on it.
1. Galaxy (N-body simulation) for both CUDA or CPU. Clicking and holding will add a very massive star in place.


## Instructions:


## Instructions to compile:
1. Install CUDA Toolkit (available upon free registration on https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
1. Clone repository.
1. Open "2D_Phys_Engine_CUDA.vcxproj" with Visual Studio 2012.
